IS445 -Data Visualization (Spring ’24)

Final Project

Biggest Takeaway from this class
What struck me as most interesting about the course were the weekly visualizations. The weekly images hammered home the point that (1) no visualization can communicate the entire complexity of a given dataset.  And (2) that data correlations need to be honest and make logical sense. I liked that you pointed out there aren’t perfect visualizations; but that some are much more effective than others. I found the ones I submitted had similar themes, I liked those that used icons or maps to deliver multiple pieces of information at once. I found that I appreciated proper scale and brevity the most. The least effective visuals were the ones that had awkward scale that changed within the image or left me with more questions than answers. A handful were extremely clear in relaying a point, others just seemed pretty and didn’t work as well.

Things Professor Uhe could improve on as a teacher
I wish the class had more structure. I’m comparing it to my introductory python class last summer and my archival management course this semester. IS 430 was a step-by-step learning Python course. The last two and a half weeks we touched on Jupyter Notebooks, Matplotlib, and Pandas. I incorrectly anticipated IS 445 would pick up where that one left off, with more practical instruction. IS 445 was more theory and assumed expertise. I was able to do the coursework and I did appreciate you not holding everyone to the same standards. 
Not being a computer science major or even an intermediate user of Python, I occasionally found myself at a loss. Had there been more of a structured framework to fall back on I probably would have gotten more out of it. I’m contrasting my archives course, where the instructor on day one gave us a full 14 week syllabus with required reading and then a slew of optional readings so we could get deeper into that week’s topic. IS 445 had a few cancelled sessions this semester, had the syllabus been more fleshed out, then I would have been able to self-direct my studies more.
I really liked the real-life example from the banking hours project presented in the April 17th class. More elements like that would have been enjoyable.
